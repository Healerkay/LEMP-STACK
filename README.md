# LEMP Stack

LEMP is a popular web development stack that consists of Linux, Nginx, MySQL (or MariaDB), and PHP. It provides a robust and efficient environment for hosting dynamic web applications.

## Components

1. **Linux**: The operating system layer of the stack. LEMP typically runs on a Linux-based distribution such as Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian.

2. **Nginx**: The web server component of the stack. Nginx is known for its high performance, stability, and scalability, making it an excellent choice for serving web content.

3. **MySQL**: The database management system (DBMS) responsible for storing and managing the application's data. MySQL is a popular choice for relational databases in the LEMP stack.

4. **PHP**: The programming language used for server-side scripting in web development. PHP is commonly used for building dynamic web pages and interacting with databases.

## Setup Instructions

To set up a LEMP stack environment:

1. **Install Linux**: Choose a Linux distribution that fits your requirements and install it on your server or local machine.

2. **Install Nginx**: Install the Nginx web server using your distribution's package manager. Configure Nginx to serve your web applications.

3. **Install MySQL**: Install either MySQL as the database management system. Secure the database server and create databases and users as needed for your applications.

4. **Install PHP**: Install PHP and any necessary PHP extensions for your applications. Configure PHP to work with Nginx.
